Overview:
        This project analyzes the relationship between mental health conditions (anxiety, depression, and panic attacks) and academic performance among students. The dataset explores trends by age, year of study, and statistical comparisons to understand these dynamics better.

Features:
    1. Data Cleaning:
            Handle missing values and convert string-based responses into numeric values for analysis.
    
    2.Mental Health Analysis by Age:
            Visualize absolute and relative frequencies of anxiety, depression, and panic attacks by age.

    3.Year of Study Analysis:
            Examine the relationship between students' ages and their current year of study.

    4.Statistical Testing
            Perform t-tests to identify significant differences between groups (e.g., students with and without anxiety).

    5.Academic Performance Analysis
            Compare average grades between students with and without depression.

    6.Visualizations
        --> Bar charts for absolute and relative frequencies of mental health conditions by age.
        --> Line plot for the relationship between age and year of study.

    7.Key Insights
        --> Students with depression have a slightly higher average grade (3.14) than those without (3.05).
        --> The t-test shows no statistically significant difference between the two groups (t = 0.654, p = 0.514).
